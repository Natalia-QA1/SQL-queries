TEST DATABASE
#
A database consisting of three tables was established for the purpose of developing a business card website for a dentist. To visualize the database structure, a database diagram was generated utilizing sqlDBM.

By employing the Mockaroo tool, a total of ten SIMULATED users, who represent patients, were generated and subsequently incorporated into the designated "users" table in order to test how the database will work.
